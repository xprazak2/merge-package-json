# merge-package-json

Intelligently merge `package.json` files.
This is pretty much built for yeoman. It attempts to combine two separate `package.json` files into one, respecting as much existing content as possible including already existing dependencies and `package.json` formatting.

## Installation

Install this module through npm or clone it:

```javascript
npm install --save merge-package-json
```
## Usage

```javascript
var merge = require('merge-package-json');
var dst = fs.readFileSync('package.a.json');
var src = fs.readFileSync('package.b.json');

// Create a new `package.json`
console.log(merge(dst, src));
```


```javascript
var merge = require('merge-package-json');
var dst = require('package.a.json');
var src = require('package.b.json');

// Create a new `package.json`
console.log(merge(dst, src));
```



```javascript
var merge = require('merge-package-json');
var src = require('package.b.json');
var dst = require('package.a.json');
var dst2 = require('package.b.json');

dst = merge(dst, src);
// Create a new `package.json`
console.log(dst);
console.log(merge(dst2, dst));
```
It allows you to do things like define scripts or dependencies that you would like to include as part of a larger project.

Merging:

```json
{
	"name": "my-package",
	"dependencies": {
		"babel": "^5.2.2",
		"lodash": "^3.2.5"
	}
}
```

```json
{
	"dependencies": {
		"babel": "^5.4.1",
		"eslint": "^0.22.1"
	}
}
```


OR


```json
{
	"dependencies": {
		"text-to-mp3": "^1.0.0"
	}
}
```

results in:

```json
{
	"name": "my-package",
	"dependencies": {
		"babel": "^5.4.1",
		"lodash": "^3.2.5",
		"eslint": "^0.22.1",
		"text-to-mp3": "^1.0.0"
	}
}
```

# TODO 
- Add MODE of merge like : 
 - Get Lates
 - Get Oldest 
 - Get Surest ( the less divergent from common used) [ need design ]
